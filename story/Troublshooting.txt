As per resubmission requirements, here are my notes regarding troubleshooting and fixing the javascript mess.

Map type didn't change because apparently I don't know how to spell satellite.

Custom icons didn't work because I used the wrong code example. It was just full-out incorrect.
I had:
// custom icons
        const icons: Record<string, {icon: string}> = {
            campsite: {
                icon: "https://vandam.nfshost.com/campsiteIcon.png",
            }
            portage: {
                icon: "https://vandam.nfshost.com/portageIcon.png"
            }
        };
        const features = [
            { position: new google.maps.LatLng(44.722030, -78.194838),type: "campsite",},
            { position: new google.maps.LatLng(44.728121, -78.197607),type: "portage",}
        ];
I don't know how that record/string works, but it would have been great to get this version working because it allowed
for an easy array for marker locations instead of making a huge pile of variables. I would have used that to show each campsite
on the lake, and then polyline to the preferred site.

The polyline, apparently was still setting the map using the variable from the example, instead of my updated canoePath. Copy+paste update fail.

removed &v=weekly from the script tag. 

That's the end of what I had attempted prior to the Lab Practical.

I added the directions after, to see if it worked calling the directions url or not. It's commented out because it didn't work.
Can you get use the directions API inside of the storymap api?
