As per resubmission requirements, here are my notes regarding troubleshooting and fixing the javascript mess.

Map type didn't change because apparently I don't know how to spell satellite.

Custom icons didn't work because I used the wrong code example. It was just full-out incorrect.
I had:
// custom icons
        const icons: Record<string, {icon: string}> = {
            campsite: {
                icon: "https://vandam.nfshost.com/campsiteIcon.png",
            }
            portage: {
                icon: "https://vandam.nfshost.com/portageIcon.png"
            }
        };
        const features = [
            { position: new google.maps.LatLng(44.722030, -78.194838),type: "campsite",},
            { position: new google.maps.LatLng(44.728121, -78.197607),type: "portage",}
        ];

removed &v=weekly from the script tag.
